        <p class="caption">15th century depiction of a jousting tournament</p>

        <p>In the 14th-16th centuries, El Born was the heart of Barcelona's noble district and hosted spectacular
            jousting tournaments. The Plaça del Born served as an open-air arena where knights demonstrated their skills
            before royalty and cheering crowds.</p>

        <p class="caption">Arc de Triomf, built for the 1888 World's Fair but echoing Barcelona's medieval past</p>

        <p>These tournaments were not just entertainment but crucial displays of military prowess. Winners gained
            prestige, royal favor, and sometimes even the hand of noble ladies. The nearby Arc de Triomf, though built
            later for the 1888 World's Fair, stands as a monument to this chivalric tradition.</p>

        <p class="caption">The iron-and-glass structure of Mercat del Born</p>

        <p>The iconic Mercat del Born, built in 1876, was Barcelona's first iron-framed structure and the city's main
            food market until 1971. Its cast-iron columns and glass roof represent the industrial revolution's impact on
            Barcelona's architecture.</p>

        <p class="caption">Archaeological remains beneath the market</p>

        <p>During renovations in 2002, workers discovered the remains of 1700s Barcelona beneath the market floor - an
            entire neighborhood demolished after the 1714 siege. Today it houses one of Europe's most remarkable urban
            archaeological sites, preserving the streets and foundations of homes destroyed during the War of Spanish
            Succession.</p>

        <img src="images/execution.png" alt="Execution scene in medieval Barcelona">
        <p class="caption">Public executions were common spectacles in medieval Barcelona</p>

        <p>For centuries, El Born served as Barcelona's primary execution ground, where justice was meted out in brutal
            public spectacles. The area witnessed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medieval punishments:</strong> Beheadings for nobility, hangings for commoners</li>
            <li><strong>Religious executions:</strong> The Spanish Inquisition burned heretics here</li>
            <li><strong>Political repression:</strong> Particularly after the 1714 siege</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="images/excution 2.jpg" alt="Execution methods diagram">
        <p class="caption">Methods of execution varied by social class and crime</p>

        <p>The most infamous executions occurred after the War of Spanish Succession (1714), when Bourbon forces made
            examples of Catalan leaders:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>President Rafael Casanova was executed despite his surrender</li>
            <li>12 other council members were publicly hanged</li>
            <li>Over 4,000 citizens were forcibly relocated</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Today, the subtle slope of Plaça del Born - designed to channel blood away - remains a sobering reminder of
            this history. The annual September 11th memorials transform the square into a sea of flowers honoring these
            martyrs of Catalan identity.</p>

        <p class="caption">Medieval water mill similar to those in 12th century Barcelona</p>

        <p>The house, originally built in the early 12th century, stood in a landscape shaped by uneven terrain, where
            cascading waterfalls created the perfect conditions for constructing mills. These mills became the heartbeat
            of the area, drawing numerous textile factories to the neighborhood and giving the street its enduring
            nickname, "The Street of the Mills."</p>

        <p>As part of the Conjunto de Balsas de San Pedro—a complex dedicated to fabric dyeing—the house played a role
            in the neighborhood's vibrant textile industry. This rich history is immortalized in Francesc Llorens i
            Riu's painting <em>Drycleaner's Shop on Basses Street in Sant Pere</em>, a visual testament to the area's
            industrial past.</p>

        <p class="caption">Sunlight filtering through ancient trees</p>

        <p><strong style="color: #2E8B57;">The Symphony of Nature</strong><br>
            This collection captures the profound joy of immersion in nature - the euphoria of sunlight through leaves,
            the freedom of forest expanses, and the quiet celebration of being present. Each piece translates the
            forest's visual poetry into watercolor harmonies.</p>

        <img src="images/forest 2.jpg" alt="Tree bark textures">

        <img src="images/forest 3.jpg" alt="Watercolor painting">

        <p><strong style="color: #2E8B57;">Contemplation Made Visible</strong><br>
            The impossible grandeur of trees - their fractal branches, their whispering leaves - once intimidated my
            brush. Yet life's journey taught me to dive fearlessly into capturing this magic. My tracing technique
            dissolves boundaries between materials, revealing nature's unified song.</p>

        <img src="images/forest 4.jpg" alt="Finished painting">

        <p><strong style="color: #2E8B57;">Watercolor Alchemy</strong><br>
            These works employ flowing water techniques to mirror nature's own liquidity - where pigments bloom like
            morning mist, and brushstrokes dance with the randomness of falling leaves. The forest's joy becomes
            tangible through the medium's spontaneous beauty.</p>

        <p><strong style="color: #6A5ACD;">The Silent Conversation</strong><br>
            Every face tells an unspoken story - a topography of experiences etched in subtle lines and expressions. In
            these portraits, I seek to capture those fleeting moments when the mask slips, revealing the vulnerable
            humanity beneath the surface.</p>

        <img src="images/face 2.jpg" alt="Artist sketching">

        <p><strong style="color: #6A5ACD;">The Alchemy of Likeness</strong><br>
            Portrait work is an act of mutual trust - the subject's courage to be seen, the artist's sensitivity to see
            truly. With each stroke, we navigate the delicate balance between representation and interpretation, between
            physical accuracy and emotional truth.</p>

        <img src="images/face 3.jpg" alt="Portrait of a woman">

        <p><strong style="color: #6A5ACD;">Faces as Landscapes</strong><br>
            I approach each portrait as I would a landscape - observing how light sculpts planes and valleys, how
            emotion colors the terrain. These studies explore the infinite variety of human expression, from quiet
            contemplation to unrestrained joy.</p>
